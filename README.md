## Spotlighting Water stress level in MENA region

### Project Objective
MENA is the most water stressed region in the world. The consumption is augmenting whereas the supply and internal freshwater availability is declining. The main objective of this project is to analyze "How the region is getting scarce and what measures has to be taken to prevent the region from getting worse".

**Key Intent**:
1. Total Available Freshwater
2. Availability of freswater per capita
3. Water Withdrawal and usage in major sectors
4. Identifying the Stress Level for MENA region
5. Dependency Percentage i.e., How much the country is depending on external resources
6. Best Strategies to opt out

### Data Collection
Collected the below mentioned data for the year range 2009 to 2019 from resources like Worldbank.com, fao.org, Our world in Data.
1. Total Renewable water resource in Billion Cubic meter 
2. Total Renewable water resource per capita 
3. Total Internal and External Water resouces in BCM
4. Water withdrawals in major sectors - Agri, Industrial, Domestic
5. Level of water stress accross the globe

### Data Cleaning
Cleaned the data in Excel and R Programming. Used Pivot functions like Pivot_longer and Pivot_wider to structure and organize the data.
