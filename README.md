The main objective of this project is to analyze "How the region is getting scarce and what measures has to be taken to prevent the region from getting worse".

**Key Purpose**:
1. Total Available Freshwater
2. Availability of freswater per capita
3. Water Withdrawal and usage in major sectors
4. Identifying the Stress Level for MENA region
5. Dependency Percentage i.e., How much the country is depending on external resources
